# WiMon
Wireless Monitoring for intrusion packet detection
run it and get local packets. For targeted results, pick a channel. 2.4ghz g2g.


Simply run the shell script and then when you have grabbed enough packets, hit ctrl-C to stop and the rest of the script will clean up your PC to inspection-worthy status, less the pcap files in the WiMonCapture directory.
